Vehicle Accident Alert is a solution that utilises AWS services for IoT Core & sends an alerting message with the time and location of an accident transmitted automatically to emergency and relief organizations by a device placed in a vehicle. As a result, they will be able to respond quickly to the accident and assist the sufferer. Got positve feedbacks for using such use case on IoT, inspired by https://www.hackster.io/kittitouchar/automatic-vehicle-accident-alert-system-using-aws-iot-0e0764
