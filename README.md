# Vehicle Accident Solution

Vehicle Accident Alert is a solution that utilises AWS services for IoT Core & sends an alerting message with the time and location of an accident transmitted automatically to emergency and relief organizations by a device placed in a vehicle. As a result, they will be able to respond quickly to the accident and assist the sufferer. Got positve feedbacks & acheive an 'A' grade for using such use case on IoT, inspired by https://www.hackster.io/kittitouchar/automatic-vehicle-accident-alert-system-using-aws-iot-0e0764

# Rekognition Label Project

Utilise the Rekognition Service for my AWS cloud technologies project & achieve an 'A' grade. The nature of the website is a photo sharing website which enables users to upload images into S3 bucket from the frontend. Once the image is uploaded, the Lamba function will be triggered which starts the label detection process using Rekognition & store the results in DynamoDB. A particular use case for such project would be identifying trends & insights on the type of images that users upload.
